Code Flow:  
	1. Use the basic method to train.  
	2. Find a better learning rate and unfreeze the end of layer in resnet34  
	  ,it could enhance our characteristic for drink and soup.  
	3. Remove similar photos and correct some labels through FastAI interpretation   
	4. Obtained a better accuracy 97.1% when recognizing soups or drinks.
